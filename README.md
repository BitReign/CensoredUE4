What is it?
===================

Simple blueprint to give you a chance to apply a visual censorship to any area in your map. Censored blueprint acts as an worldspace volume and it can be resized or rotated. It can be placed anywhere in your map just like any other object. 

You can also set mosaic tiling amount and multipliying color by your choice.

Why GitHub?
===================

I've tried to submit it to the marketplace for free but it has been rejected, so here we are : )

Which engine versions supported?
===================

Current Unreal Engine version: **4.17**
